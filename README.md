### Architecture

- **Main architecture:** The main architecture contains 3 main parts.

  - **Models:** Consist of data structures called entities. Represent inner logics and provide developer-friendly interfaces.
  - **Services:** Stateless, globally accessible sets of utility functions.

  - **Components:** React components.

- **Interaction between models and components:** `WorkspaceEntity` provides the main entry point for React components. Services may act as intermediate in this interaction.
